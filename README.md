This project came out as a part of my Network Security project at NYU during Fall 2022. 
In this repository, I will maintain code for a library which can be used for achieving end to end differential privacy solution over a dataset for some queries.

So far, only the POC is done. Please check the attached jupyter notebook.

Plan:
1. Use genetic algorithms to implement better budget allocation.
2. Support more kinds of queries.
3. Integrate with existing DP libraries so as to implement more differential privacy mechanisms.
4. Add alogirthms which optimize total percentage error of all queries.
